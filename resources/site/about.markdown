 title: Hi!

 My name is Hannah Atkinson and I am a Software Engineer. I thrive
 in collaborative environments where I am continuously challenged to be
 better than I was yesterday.  I push code to [GitHub]("https://github.com/hlatki"),
 occasionally [blog]("http://hlatki.github.io"), and sometimes even [tweet]("https://twitter.com/hlatkin").
 On the weekend, I brunch.
