However, I've only managed to make one post. Although this is a pretty standard for any new journal or blog, I've decided another key reason is that I've spent way too much time trying to get Octopress to work correctly. Now that's not quite fair since I think the root cause probably has more to do with Ruby Version Manager and my poor installation thereof, but the fact remains that whenever I've started to write a new post I've ended up off in the weeds fighting with Ruby or messing with Octopress's configuration.</p><p>Octopress is a cool piece of software, but I really don't need all of its power. I just want a straightforward static site generator that parses markdown, and I hope that I've found it in <a href="https://github.com/nakkaya/static">nakkaya's Static</a>, a static site generator written in Clojure. </p><p>Here's to posting more frequently!</p></p></div></div><div id="disqus"></div></div><div id="footer"><a href="/rss-feed"> RSS Feed</a><p>&copy; 2013<a href="http://hannah.io"> Hannah Atkinson</a></p></div></div></body></html>
