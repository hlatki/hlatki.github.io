So you reach for C++ and -- haha, of course you don't because that would be crazy (I see you over there, Java, and no, back into the corner you go). Node.js is my goto solution in situations like this.</p><p>A few days ago I was doing some early Spring cleaning and found some old code from when I was first experimenting with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>. Backbone's <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Sync">sync</a> makes it super easy to persist data; you might not even have to configure routes if your API is already RESTful. I, however, did not have a RESTful API. I had a silly little kanban style todo list running in my browser. Node.js to the rescue!</p><p>Node is great. But out of the box, manipulating HTTP requests and responses is a little less abstract than we want for prototyping an API. That's where <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> comes in. Express is a web application framework for Node, and it makes set up routes a piece of cake.</p><p>First, (and assuming you already have Node installed), let's install Express:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">npm install express --save
</code></pre><p>If you already have a <code>package.json</code> file in your project directory, the <code>--save</code> flag will add Express to your dependencies.</p><p>Now let's make a simple REST API for some to-do items. Since this is just for testing purposes, we'll use an array instead of a fancy database to hold our data. Note that the following example is extremely crude, and is totally lacking in any sort of error checking. However, I think it shows how quickly you can get a somewhat useful "fake" backend up and running.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint"><br/>var express = require(&#39;express&#39;),
app = express(),
PORT = 8008;
//array of tasks
var tasks = [{id: 0, title: &quot;Learn more about Backbone&quot;, description:&quot;Do research on best practices&quot;, col: &quot;inProgress&quot;},
{id: 1, title: &quot;Get Drag and Drop to work&quot;, col:&quot;completed&quot;},
{id: 2, title: &quot;Experiment with local storage for tasks&quot;, col: &quot;completed&quot;}];

/*
 * REST TIME!!
 */
//Get some JSON
app.get(&#39;/api/tasks&#39;, function(req, res){
        console.log(&#39;GET /api/tasks&#39;);
        console.log(tasks);
        res.send(tasks);
});
//get a particular task
app.get(&#39;/api/tasks/:id&#39;, function(req,res){
        var id = req.params.id;
        console.log(&#39;getting task &#39; + id);
        res.send(tasks[id]);
});
//add a task
app.post(&#39;/api/tasks&#39;, function(req,res){
        var task = req.body;
        task.id = tasks.length;
        console.log(req.body);
        console.log(&#39;adding task: &#39; + task);
        tasks.push(task);
        console.log(tasks);
});

//update a task
app.put(&#39;/api/tasks/:id&#39;, function(req,res){
        var id = req.params.id;
        var task = req.body;
        console.log(&#39;updating task &#39; + id + &#39; to &#39; + JSON.stringify(task));
        tasks[id] = task;
        console.log(tasks);
});
app.listen(PORT);
console.log(&#39;Listening on port &#39; + PORT);

However, I've only managed to make one post. Although this is a pretty standard for any new journal or blog, I've decided another key reason is that I've spent way too much time trying to get Octopress to work correctly. Now that's not quite fair since I think the root cause probably has more to do with Ruby Version Manager and my poor installation thereof, but the fact remains that whenever I've started to write a new post I've ended up off in the weeds fighting with Ruby or messing with Octopress's configuration.</p><p>Octopress is a cool piece of software, but I really don't need all of its power. I just want a straightforward static site generator that parses markdown, and I hope that I've found it in <a href="https://github.com/nakkaya/static">nakkaya's Static</a>, a static site generator written in Clojure. </p><p>Here's to posting more frequently!</p></p></div><div class="pager-left"><a href="/latest-posts/0/">&laquo; Older Entries</a></div></div><div id="disqus"></div></div><div class="footer"><ul class="nav-links"><li>&copy; 2013<a href="http://hannah.io"> Hannah Atkinson</a></li><li><a href="/rss-feed">RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/colophon.html">Colophon</a></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
